  <h2>Overview of processing</h2>
  <p>
    The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and
    refers to the data subjects.
  </p>
  <h3>Types of data processed</h3>
  <p>Contact data, content data, usage data, metadata, communication data, process data.</p>
  <h3>Categories of affected persons</h3>
  <p>Communication partner</p>
  <h3>Purposes of the processing</h3>
  <p>
    Contact requests and communication, managing and responding to requests, feedback, providing our online
    services and user-friendliness.
  </p>

  <h2>Relevant legal bases</h2>
  <p>
    Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal
    data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations
    may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases also apply
    in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR)</h3>
  <p>
    Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
    third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
    freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
  </p>
  <h3>National data protection regulations in Germany</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in
    Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data
    Processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on
    the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special
    categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated
    decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. The data protection laws of the individual
    federal states may also apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Security measures</h2>
  <p>
    We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements,
    taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances
    and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of
    the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection
    appropriate to the risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
    data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure,
    safeguarding of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that
    ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS):</strong> To protect user data transmitted via our online services,
    we use TLS/SSL encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing Internet
    connections by encrypting the data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or between two
    servers). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an updated and more secure version of SSL. HTTPS is displayed
    in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.
  </p>

  <h2>Deletion of data</h2>
  <p>
    The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as the
    consent given for processing is revoked or other permissions no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose for
    processing this data no longer applies or it is not required for the purpose). If the data is not
    deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing is restricted
    to these purposes. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This
    applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage
    is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another
    natural or legal person. Our data protection notices may also contain further information on the
    retention and deletion of data, which take priority for the respective processing operations.
  </p>

  <h2>Rights of the data subjects</h2>
  <p>
    As a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from
    Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right to object</li>
    <li>Right to withdraw consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
    <li>Right to information: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data in question
      is being processed and to request information about this data as well as further information and a
      copy of the data.</li>
    <li>Right to rectification: You have the right to request the completion of data concerning you or the
      correction of incorrect data concerning you.</li>
    <li>Right to erasure and restriction of processing: You have the right to demand that data concerning
      you be deleted immediately or restricted.</li>
    <li>Right to data portability: You have the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly used
      and machine-readable format or to request its transmission to another controller.</li>
    <li>Complaint to the supervisory authority: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
      authority if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Amendment and updating of the privacy policy</h2>
  <p>
    We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our privacy policy. We will adapt the
    privacy policy as soon as changes to the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We
    will inform you as soon as the changes require an act of cooperation on your part (e.g. consent) or
    other individual notification.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions of terms</h2>
  <p>
    This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Insofar as the
    terms are defined by law, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, on the other hand,
    are primarily intended to aid understanding.

  </p>
  <h3>Responsible person</h3>

    The ‘controller’ is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or
