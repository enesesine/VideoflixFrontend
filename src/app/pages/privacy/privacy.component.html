  <h2>Overview of processing</h2>

    The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the
    purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.
  </p>

    Contact data, content data, usage data, metadata, communication data,
    process data.
  </p>
  <h3>Categories of affected persons</h3>
  <p>Communication partner</p>
  <h3>Purposes of the processing</h3>

  </p>

  <h2>Relevant legal bases</h2>
  <p>
    Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis
    of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
    provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in
    your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal
    bases also apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the
    privacy policy.
  </p>
  <h3>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR)</h3>
  <p>
    Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
    pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests
    are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
    data subject which require protection of personal data.
  </p>
  <h3>National data protection regulations in Germany</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data
    protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the
    Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing
    (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains
    special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the
    right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data,
    processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated
    decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. The data
    protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Security measures</h2>
  <p>
    We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance
    with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the
    implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of
    the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the
    extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in
    order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic
    access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, safeguarding of
    availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established
    procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of
    data and responses to data threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS):</strong> To protect user data
    transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL encryption.
  </p>

  <h2>Deletion of data</h2>
  <p>
    The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal
    requirements as soon as the consent given for processing is revoked or
    other permissions no longer apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Rights of the data subjects</h2>
  <p>
    As a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which
    arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right to object</li>
    <li>Right to withdraw consent</li>
    <li>Right to information</li>
    <li>Right to rectification</li>
    <li>Right to erasure and restriction of processing</li>
    <li>Right to data portability</li>
    <li>Complaint to the supervisory authority</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Amendment and updating of the privacy policy</h2>
  <p>
    We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our privacy
    policy. We will adapt it as soon as changes to the data processing we carry
    out make this necessary.
